This grandfather clock was 9 feet 4 inches tall, made in Boise by 
A. R. Blackstone in 1900.  Originally this clock was in an Idaho
 City Bank.  It has belonged to several prominent Boise families, 
finally finding a home in the Gold Rush Dining Room, The Royal 
Restaurant, Boise Idaho.<br><br>
