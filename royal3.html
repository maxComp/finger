<b>Remember the Royal? Its former employees do
</b><br>
Idaho Statesman March 15, 2000</center><br><br>

Two decades after its demise, the Royal Restaurant still holds a place in the hearts of those who made 
it a Boise institution. They meet once a month for lunch, and memories.

"To some people, it was just a restaurant," former Royal waitress Pam Wells said over lunch at the 
Chef's Hut. "To us, it was family."

<p>Few who knew the Royal, a downtown landmark from the 1940s until it closed in 1982, remember it as just another restaurant. Before there was a Desert Sage or Peter Schott's or the Gamekeeper, the Royal was the restaurant. In a smaller, more innocent Boise, it was where people went to get engaged, celebrate anniversaries, tear up the mortgage. If an occasion was special enough, the Royal was where you went.

"It was just the best," former cook May Embry said. "We didn't use anything inferior. We bought the best cuts of meat, the best ingredients for every recipe. And every chef had a special secret."

"Remember the grasshopper pie?" onetime waitress Betty Archer asked anyone who happened to be listening.

A chorus of ahhh's rose from two crowded tables of Royal alumni.

"And the homemade cheesecake and spumoni!" someone piped up.

"And the strawberry festival! Remember those mountains of strawberries and whipped cream?"

"And the Fish-o-Rama! The fish bar must have been 60 feet long - fresh salmon, crab, shrimp, clams - All you could eat for $5.95."

<p>It's no accident that the group meets at the Chef's Hut. Owner Corky Brown used to be a Royal chef.

Dessert for his former colleagues was one of his old specialties, Royal eclairs.

"He's a Royal success story," former officer manager Vera Hill said. "He started as a busboy and went on to become the chef and kitchen manager."

"He could bus more tables than three of these kids today," Archer said. "One thing the Royal taught you was how to work."

Former bartender Gene Alworth recalled his 14 years there as "the only job I ever had that I couldn't wait to get up to go to work. It was like I'd died and gone to heaven."

Why?

"Because it was more than a restaurant," Archer said. "We all cared about each other. We helped each other through divorces, health problems, financial problems. We all loved Ed and Vince (owners Ed Graves and Vince Aguirre), and we all knew how they felt about us.

"There were people who worked there over 30 years. There were over 100 employees, but it really was like a family."

A family getting on in years now, they meet to relive the best years of their lives and remember absent friends - Ed, Vince, Joe, Bill, Eva, Esther and others - who have gone to the great restaurant in the sky.

"It's a funny thing," Archer said. "You wouldn't think so after all this time, but we still run into customers who say there'll never be another Royal. How many restaurants have that kind of effect on people?"
