Originally constructed in the 1940's, the all-brick building featured curved,
 glass block windows in the front corners (later filled in during the brief 
time that Garden City permitted gambling in the town). When Willie Schrier 
purchased the property and began to build on his dream in the late '50's, the 
abandoned site had previously been used for social gatherings, as a gambling 
casino and then subsequently a dance hall.
