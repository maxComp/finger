<b>Restaurant-Bar Opens
</b><br>
Idaho Statesman October 5, 1947</center><br><br>

A combination restaurant and bar opened Oct. 1 at 1112. Main street and is operated by Vince Aguirre 
and Ed Graves, Named the New Royal, the establishment appears to be the most recent word in modern decor.
Twenty-seven red leather upholstered stools line a bar finished in birch, prima vera and mahogany and 
faces eight overstuffed booths done in red and gray leather. The entire motif follows a red and gray 
color scheme. A "different" type wall finish has been applied along two of the walls; finished 
in a flat gray paint, striking gold spots form an attractive pattern.
Large photographs of Idaho scenes are paneled behind the back bar and ample mirroring fills 
in along that wall.
At present, the Royal plans to specialize in businessmen's lunches and will concentrate on food at 
reasonable prices, Aguirre stated. He added that the bar sells only beer now, although a liquor 
license may be applied for at a later date.
