Prior to opening the Stagecoach Inn, Willie had previous experience in the 
hospitality business, first as part-owner of a bar in Emmett, Idaho; then 
in the late 1940's he opened "Willie's Say When" lounge in Garden City. 
From 1953-1958, Willie owned and operated the "Torch", where he created an 
Idaho original: Finger Steaks. Willie left his finger steaks recipe with Milo, 
promising never to compete with the Torch by serving finger steaks at 
the Stagecoach Inn.
